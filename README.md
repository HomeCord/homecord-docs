# HomeCord Documentation

> [!NOTE]
> HomeCord's Documentation being here is a temporary measure so its developer can focus on developing HomeCord v1.0.0 - HomeCord will get some actual documentation once its v1.0.0 version has been developed.

Welcome to documentation for HomeCord's beta versions!
