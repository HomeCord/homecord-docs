# HomeCord Documentation

> [!NOTE]
> HomeCord's Documentation being here is a temporary measure so its developer can focus on developing HomeCord v1.0.0 - HomeCord will get some actual documentation once its v1.0.0 version has been developed.

---

Welcome to documentation for HomeCord's beta versions!

This index page will serve as a table of contents so you can easily find any information you're looking for while HomeCord is in its beta phase.

If you want to add HomeCord to your own Server, [use its Bot Invite Link here!](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1156152328290840606&permissions=537250896&scope=applications.commands+bot)

*If the Invite Link shows an error about the Bot not being publicly invitible, that's because HomeCord is still in a Beta phase - and as such, it's invite may be randomly disabled at times to ensure a smooth Beta phase. It will be made fully public once its full release is ready.*

*In the meantime, if you want to keep up to date on HomeCord's development, feel free to join HomeCord's [Support Server](https://discord.gg/4bFgUyWUMY).*
