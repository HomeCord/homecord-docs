# How can I prevent my own Messages from being highlighted or featured to HomeCord's Home Channels?

If you don't want HomeCord to highlight *any* of your own Messages in *any* Server that HomeCord is in; simply use the `/preferences` Command, setting the `featureable` option to False.

Doing this will also prevent Server Moderators & Admins from manually featuring your Messages with HomeCord too.

If you want to allow your Messages to be highlightable/featureable again, simply run that same `/preferences` Command, setting `featureable` to True.

> [!NOTE]
> This User preference applies to *ALL* Servers both you and HomeCord are in. You can*not* set this preference on a per-Server basis, *only* on a global basis.
