## Commands: Permission Requirements

If you want to override the default Permission requirements for HomeCord's Commands, you can do so by going to **Server Settings > Integrations > HomeCord** in your Server, and editing the Command Permission requirements there.

> [!NOTE]
> Sadly, you can only edit Bot Command Permissions on Desktop & Web versions of Discord, not Mobile versions.
