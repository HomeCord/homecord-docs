# What is the HomeCord Bot?

HomeCord is a Discord Bot designed to recreate and improve upon the old [Server Home Tab](<https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6156116949911>) Discord once experimented with.

With HomeCord, you can create your own "Home Channel" for your Server - a place for you to see:
- Permanently Featured Channels
- Highlighted Messages
- Upcoming Scheduled Events
- Popular/Active Threads & Forum/Media Posts

HomeCord's "Home" Channel is great for lurkers to see what's going on and potentially become full Server Members!
It's also great for your active Members - who may miss a few days and want to use the "Home" Channel to catch up, or you can use this "Home" Channel for improved Thread discoverability!

All parts of HomeCord's "Home" Channel are toggleable & customisable - and your Server Moderators/Admins can even manually feature Messages, Channels, Threads/Posts, and Events for a short time to bring more attention to them!

> [!NOTE]
> If automatic highlighting is enabled, HomeCord will only be able to automatically highlight Channels, Thread/Posts, Events, and Messages it has access to in your Server. So if HomeCord doesn't have "View Channel" Permissions for a Channel, it won't automatically highlight it nor any Threads/Messages in that Channel!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HomeCord is still in very active development, and thus everything on this page, and documentation, is subject to change while HomeCord heads towards its stable v1.0.0 full release!
