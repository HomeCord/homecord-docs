# HomeCord Beta Changelog

> [!NOTE]
> *This changelog is ordered by newest to oldest.*

---

## Beta Build 6
> *Released 13th April 2024*

- Lowered cooldown for `/setup`, from 600 seconds down to 60 seconds.
- `/setup` now checks the HomeCord's Permissions if you try to select the "Create for Me" option in the initial Setup Page.
- Updated HomeCord's Invite Link to ask for `MANAGE_CHANNELS` and `MANAGE_WEBHOOKS` Permissions by default. These are just for easing the setup process.
  - *Thanks to the peeps in [Discord Admins](https://dis.gd/dac-faq) Server for suggesting the above three!*
- The length of time HomeCord will keep automatically highlighted items on Home Channels is now dependant on the respective Activity Thresholds
  - In other words: lower thresholds will mean highlighted items stay on Home longer. Higher thresholds mean shorter durations for highlighted items.
